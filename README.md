# Patient Record Blockchain Project

This is a blockchain-based project for storing patient records securely using Ethereum smart contracts. The project involves four types of users: admin, hospital, insurance company, and patient. The admin user has the authority to create hospitals and insurance companies, while hospitals can create patients, add patient records, and assign patients to other hospitals or insurance companies. Insurance companies can view the details of patients shared with them, and patients can access their own profile and see which hospitals and insurance companies have access to their data.
